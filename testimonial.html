      <div class="extra_content">
        <p>"Faisal has been an outstanding SEN Learning Mentor for our son who is in senior school - based upon our Y10 experience we unreservedly recommend him. Faisal was able to help channel Thomas's enthusiasm to learn by connecting each teacher with Thomas's needs in the classroom.  This improved Thomas's engagement with learning and his academic results improved. Faisal kept in daily touch.  He leveraged his SEN experience to tailor approaches which worked for Thomas's learning needs and helped us work with the school to implement them. Faisal made suggestions and engaged in dialogue with Thomas and with us to shape the best options for learning and social engagement. Faisal really got to know our son and his learning and social needs and was proactive in helping to deliver a tailored experience for Thomas which built his personal and social confidence and helped him achieve materially improved academic results."</p>

      <h1>"We would definitely hire Faisal again and recommend him wholeheartedly to other families!"</h1>
      <p class="main_content">I.B & Z.K (Parents)</p>
      <div class="extra_content">
        <p>"We hired Faisal to care for our 11 year-old son during the summer, while we were visiting London from the United States. Our son is sweet, empathic, imaginative, and funny - and has disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, ADHD, and anxiety. All of which mean that he can become dysregulated easily, and when he does, he can curse and be physically aggressive. We were introduced to Faisal in the summer of 2023 by a former co-worker of his at a school for special needs. Faisal spent several days with our son that summer, and the two of them really hit it off, so we hired Faisal again. He was with our son 5-6 hours a day, 5 days a week, for about 4 weeks while we were working. They would go on long walks on the local common, play football, explore areas of London, or go see a movie. Occasionally, Faisal also took along one or two of our other sons, though usually it was just him and our 11 year-old. Faisal was kind, thoughtful, and professional. Our son had a great time with him and looked forward to hanging out each day. Faisal really worked to get to know and understand our son. He handled our son&#39;s various social challenges with patience. Faisal was thoughtful in his approach, adapting routines to maximize the chance of a successful day. For instance, transitions are very difficult for our son, making him reluctant to leave the house. However, staying home for long stretches without much to do often leads to dysregulation. So, instead of coming in and hanging out, often Faisal would meet our son at the front door and they would head out immediately to start their adventures. Faisal was communicative with us as parents. He would let us know if there were any concerns, and give his ideas about how to best address them. He came up with good ideas about how the two of them could spend their days, and always was careful to ensure the activity was both interesting and appropriate. He was able to match our son&#39;s energy and was willing to play the imagination games our son craves. We would definitely hire Faisal again and recommend him wholeheartedly to other families!"</p>

      <div class="extra_content">
        <p>"I really liked my time with Faisal. It was fun because we could do all sorts of things together and all the time we had fun. We played football a lot, and went outside and walked lots of different places in London. Faisal was joyful, funny, and a very fun person to be around. He was also very chill. If I didn&#39;t want to do something, he would try, but didn&#39;t force me to do anything. He was calm, adventurous, and liked telling stories. Faisal was considerate and very kind about any struggles I had, including my anger issues. I would recommend him 100%. He&#39;s one of the best manny's / mentors for people with special needs that I&#39;ve ever had."</p>

      <div class="extra_content">
        <p>"Faisal has been working with our son (12yrs) since November 2023 after first meeting him at his Specialist school &#8209; sadly the placement did not succeed but we were over the moon when Faisal came to work with us independently. Our son is ASD/PDA, he is bright, funny and super kind but has various complex needs. Faisal has been instrumental in our son&#39;s development over the last year, building confidence, life skills, understanding &#8209; basically he 	&#8216;gets&#8217; him and they have huge amounts of fun. Faisal works with our son as a learning support mentor/coach and works with a number of other professionals (SALT, EP, CAMHS, OT, Tutor) to ensure that the provision set out in our son&#39;s EHCP is delivered holistically. Faisal has enormous enthusiasm, drive and dedication &#8209; nothing fazes him and he is an absolute joy to be around. He is dedicated to our son&#39;s development and thinks nothing of deep diving into research to discover alternative methods of engagement that might just work for our son when everything else seems to have failed. We have a lot of hope for the future, our son would not have made such progress without Faisal&#39;s unique approach and understanding towards kids with complex needs. Thank you Faisal &#8209; you&#39;re a superstar!"</p>
