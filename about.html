  <h1>About Us</h1>

  <div class="about_content_box">

    <div class="text_box">
      <p><b>Welcome to SEN Manny Mentor!</b> I'm Faisal, a skilled mentor and SEN manny with extensive experience working with children who have special educational needs.</p>

      <p>With a foundation in Drama and Theatre Studies and a career rooted in hands-on support, I bring creativity, patience, and unwavering commitment to each child I mentor. My mission is clear: to empower SEN children to become <b>independent thinkers</b> and learners who can navigate life with <b>emotional resilience</b> and <b>self-assurance</b>.</p>

      <h2>Experience & Specializations</h2>

      <p>Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of working closely with children with autism, ADHD, and other additional needs—helping them build confidence, overcome challenges, and develop key life skills. My experience includes years as an SEN PE Teacher, where I focused on more than just physical activity. I created sessions that helped kids with resilience, anxiety management, social skills, and teamwork—all while making sure they had fun and felt supported.

Beyond the classroom, I’ve worked one-on-one with children as a private SEN mentor and tutor, creating tailored sessions to meet their unique needs. Whether it’s helping with emotional regulation, life skills development, or boosting personal growth, my goal is always to help kids feel more confident and capable in their own skin.

I’ve also had the chance to collaborate with NHS Speech and Language Therapists, Occupational Therapists, and Educational Psychologists, which has given me great insight into different approaches and strategies that really work.</p>

      <h2>Approach & Philosophy</h2>

      <p>I believe every child is different, and my approach is all about meeting them where they are. Whether it’s helping them become more independent thinkers, motivated learners, or simply building up their confidence, I’m here to support them on their journey in a way that feels natural and empowering.

My background in acting—featuring roles in Silent Witness (BBC), Professor T (ITV/Apple TV), The Personal History of David Copperfield (Amazon), and So Awkward (CBBC)—also plays a big role in how I work with kids. I like to incorporate creativity, imagination, and play into sessions, which makes learning enjoyable and helps kids express themselves more freely. At the end of the day, I’m here to help kids thrive—not just academically, but emotionally too. It’s about creating a safe, supportive space where they feel heard, understood, and ready to take on whatever life throws at them.


</p>

      <h2>Commitment to Growth</h2>

      <p>This commitment to growth ensures my approach is both compassionate and highly effective. Families consistently share positive testimonials about the impact of my work, from easing school anxiety to boosting confidence and fostering independence.</p>

      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>

      <p>At SEN Manny Mentor, I create a nurturing, supportive environment where every child can flourish, realize their potential, and step confidently into their future as capable, independent learners.</p>
